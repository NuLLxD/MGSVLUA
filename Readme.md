Thanks to user @Lag

Thanks to everyone in the thread who contributed.

Note: To use the Easy S Rank Missions/Removal of rank restrictions on items LUA you must use the dictionary.txt included in the QAR folder and TPPResults.LUA I have in included in the LUA folder.

*** Important ***

As of MGSV:TPP v1.0.0.6 you can now push all LUA updates to D:\Steam\steamapps\common\MGS_TPP\master\0\00 or 01.dat and the game will register changes.

00.dat contains the fix for Quiets mission bugs and 01.dat is empty. Use 01.dat.
